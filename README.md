This is a file archiving system. You submit it files with a set of metadata, as
key-value pairs, and it allows you to later retrieve the files that match
conditions on these metadata.

It uses a flat file-store where files are stored under their 40 characters SHA1
hash, and a SQLite3 database for the metadata.

Its purpose is to be used as a persistent file store for the VisTrails workflow
and provenance management system: http://www.vistrails.org/
